# storeconfigs: We explicitly disable stored configs and do not use
# exported resources because we consider it an anti-pattern to trust

# Also, using exported resources to configure other services means
# the puppetdb becomes a second source of truth that must be available
# and yet cannot deliver the level of record-level integrity that we
# demand via cryptographic hashes of the data. Additionally, stored
# configs and exported resources require manual, non-reproducible
# action to purge in case a node is deactivated. Here's a quote from
# http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppetdb/2.1/maintain_and_tune.html
#
# > Deactivating a node does not remove (e.g. ensure => absent)
# > exported resources from other systems; it only stops managing
# > those resources. If you want to actively destroy resources from
# > deactivated nodes, you will probably need to purge that resource
# > type using the resources metatype. Note that some types cannot
# > be purged (e.g. ssh authorized keys), and several others usually
# > should not be purged (e.g. users).
